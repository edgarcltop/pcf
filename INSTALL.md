# Installing the P2PCF Cloudflare Worker

Setting up the worker is a few simple steps.

### Create a Cloudflare account

Go to https://www.cloudflare.com/ and create an account.

### Set up the R2 bucket

1. In the Cloudflare console, go to R2:

2. Click Create Bucket

3. Enter any bucket name you want (we use `p2pcf`)

4. Click `Create Bucket`

### Create the Cloudflare Worker

1. In the Cloudflare console, go to `Workers` in the main navigation:

2. Then, `Create a Service`

3. Enter any service name you want (we use `p2pcf`). Leave the starter type as `HTTP Handler`. Press `Create service`.

#### Bind the worker to R2

1. In your Worker's view, click the `Settings` tab:

3. Scroll down to `R2 Bucket Bindings` and click `Add Binding`:

4. Choose any binding name you want (we use `BUCKET`), and choose the bucket you created earlier. Click `Save`.

#### Deploy the worker code

1. Go back to your worker's dashboard. To get there `Workers` in the main navigation:

2. Click on your worker:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/220020/181830606-20322fe4-fdc8-409d-b5eb-a002b6cb22e5.png)

3. Click on `Quick Edit`. This will open the code editor.

4. Now, in a separate tab, open the [worker source](https://github.com/gfodor/p2pcf/blob/master/src/worker.js) from https://github.com/gfodor/p2pcf/blob/master/src/worker.js and copy it. (Click `Raw` to get the raw text.)

5. Paste it into the editor, click `Save and Deploy`, and click to confirm the deployment.

6. Your worker is now deployed and ready to be used. Hit the URL to your worker (under `Routes`) to make sure it's working:

7. If you are on a paid plan, it is highly recommended you ensure your worker is in the `Bundled` usage model, which will increase your unmetered requests by 10x. The worker is very CPU efficient so should work fine in this usage model. You can find it in `Settings`.

8. (Optional) You can add two other optional variables in the `Environment Variables` in `Settings` to increase the security of your worker.
 - `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`: A comma-separated list of origins that will be allowed to access the worker. If you're not offering a public worker, this is recommended.
   - Example: `https://mysite.com,https://app.mysite.com` would limit use of the worker to secured sites running on `mysite.com` or `app.mysite.com`.
 - `ORIGIN_QUOTA`: Number of requests per month to allow for any origin not specified in `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`. If you're offering a public worker, this is recommended to rate limit public usage. The default is 10000 if you have not restricted origins via `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` and zero if origins are restricted (so if you restrict origins, other origins will have no access by default.)
   - Example: `100` would limit use of the worker to 100 requests per month from a given origin.

#### Use your worker in your code

The URL to your worker can be found at the top of the console view of your worker:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/220020/181832545-e5306fa4-b408-41e0-be07-027dc4eeab41.png)

To use your worker in your client code, specify it as the `workerUrl` in the options passed to the `P2PCF` constructor:

```
import P2PCF from 'p2pcf'

const p2pcf = new P2PCF('MyUsername', 'MyRoom', { workerUrl: "https://p2pcf.minddrop.workers.dev" })
```

That's it! You now have a free (or cheap) WebRTC signalling server that will stay up as long as Cloudflare is working.
